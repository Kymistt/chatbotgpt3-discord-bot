# Discord Bot GPT-3 

 Discord bot that uses the OpenAI API to generate responses to messages. When the bot receives a message in the specified channel, it passes the message to the bot_response function.

 The bot_response function uses the OpenAI Completion API to generate a response to the message. It then sends the response as an embed in the Discord channel. If an error occurs, the bot sends a message indicating that it doesn't understand the question.
